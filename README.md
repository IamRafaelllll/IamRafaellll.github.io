## Rafael Francisco Perez

My name is **Rafael Francisco Perez** and I am a rising senior at Lowell High School. I have taken **Mr.Chan's** AP Computer Science A class, where I learned Java. I have also learned a variety of other coding languages, such as **Python**, **JavaScript**, **C#**, and **Unity Game Design**, through a organization called [**MissionBit**](https://www.missionbit.org/). I am also part of MissionBit's **Student Advisory Board**, where I work with a team of other MissionBit students and collaborate to strengthen the MissionBit program.
